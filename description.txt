Combat+ is an ambitious mod, which strives to rework almost all of Terraria's combat system.
NPCs will have more interesting combat techniques, and will no longer maintain constant hitboxes.
Bows will have a delay from their drawstring, Repeaters will need to be reloaded, guns will have a magazine, rocket launchers will need to be reloaded. Other launchers will vary.
Mages' spells have a proper cast time, and mana will be much more of a significant resource.
- Cast-time stagger from damage
Melee gets an indirect buff from non-constant NPC hitboxes, but will also be made more viable in other ways from NPC ai.
Minions will be given an explicit attack animation, rather than contact damage.
Critical stats are more fleshed out -- lower chances, higher/more dramatic effect, variable crit damage multiplier
