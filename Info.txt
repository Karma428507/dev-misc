Design Plans:
NO CONTENT WILL BE ADDED in the form of Items, NPCs, Projectiles, Tiles, and the like.
All modifications will be behavioural (how does an item behave, how do NPCs behave) and API-based (which NPCs shoot projectiles, which ones fly, etc)

Community Input:
- Remove Projectiles from most melee weapons
- Make early temple entry work (seriously, you can just have platforms and it works, but RoD is illegal???)
- Fix "shimmer" exploits legitimately (none of this halfsies bullshit)
- Remove or rework whips
- Dodge roll? Reload? Draw bowstring?

Interpretation:
- Reduce melee AoE and some damage, remove NPCs' constant hitbox
- IL or Detour early temple nonsense
- Custom "shimmer" rules, probably have to IL or Detour
- Retaining whips, client-side rework to minions that, on staff right click, all minions of that type perform a unique attack, at the cost of mana per minion
- Optional reload and bow mechanics, server-side



Other Ideas:
- Melee swings suck, add a couple usestyles (directional swings, maybe throw[?], charged jabs/strikes[?])
- Enemy AI rewrite (accomodate lost constant hitboxes, allow both friendly AND hostile targetting)
- NPC data (flying, swiming, etc) + Mod.Call to add to data
- Element system[?], weaknesses, resistances/strengths {Blood:Crimson, Curse:Corruption/Dungeon, Holy:Hallow, Ice:Tundra, Fire:Hell, Earth:Jungle/Caverns, Wind:Sky/Space}
- Revert stupid seed changes (DST seed having filter on 24/7, some items not being able to be purchased, etc)

NPC Changes:
- NPC AI Rewrite (to include confusion behaviour, hostile/friendly targetting, dynamic movement, add enemy grief to some AI)
- Constant Hitbox -> Situational Hitbox
- IgnoresWater, ShootsProjectile, SpawnsNPC, Flies, TargetsNPCs, ...
- Gradually increase item droprates by some function as a given NPC type is killed, reset when item is dropped

Item Changes:
- Sword Swings
- Reworking Melee Projectiles (removing several, reducing effective area of several, making ranged-melee an actual rarity)
- Melee Speed (melee speed strong stat, and instead of making it arbitrarily not affect some things, it should not be possible to achieve exploitative values)
- Bow Draw
- Ranged Ammo Qty (more difficult to get effectively infinite ammunition)
- Summoning-Staff Alt-Use
- Summon Balance (damage, AI, etc)
- Fixed stack size (none of this 9999 stack bullshit)
- Recover Potion Rework (recovery over time, or diminishing returns on use but no strong cooldown)
- Ancient Cloth Vanity to Whip Set (obsidian outlaw went from vanity to nontype defence to whip set, so I think change recipes on this set and make it a hardmode whip set)
- Worm Scarf adjusted from 17% DR -> 10% DR
- Brain of Confusion adjusted from 16.67% dodge to 12% dodge
- Black Belt adjusted from 10% dodge -> 15% dodge

Buff Changes:
- Effects are consistent when applied to NPCs and when applied to Player (see: Venom 30 dps against NPCs vs 15 dps against Players)
- Buffs with similar hardmode variants (On Fire, Frostburn, etc)
- Venom changed to have -10 def effect, and adjusted to 10 dps
- Ichor adjusted to -20 def effect
- Cursed Inferno adjusted to 20 dps
- Confused applies to more enemies

UI Changes:
- Accessibility Toggle for Info Accessories (client-side config, disable colour alteration)
- Drop-Down for Ammo Display Style (client-side config, all|next to cursor|next to item|none)

Mechanical Changes:
- Mana Rework (+max mana, -regen, stronger effect from applicable accessories, mana regen pot needs slight nerf, mana should feel like a much more substantial resource)
- Uncraft Liquid Fix (revert Relogic changes, implement ones that make sense and are consistent)
- Early Temple (allow teleporter, RoD/RoH, actuator, etc, allow wire modification)
- Dodge Functionality (dodges either WORK or they DON'T WORK, none of this halfsies bullshit -- making dodges work, but reducing times/chances)
- Loadout Cooldown (seriously, swapping between them SHOULD NOT be completely free, NO, they aren't the same as just autopause because you don't sacrifice inventory slots)

Config [Default]:
- Allow Enemy Grief (server-side, enemies with applicable AI can break or change tiles) [On]
- Usestyle Alts (server-side, enables/disables usestyle changes, enables changing other options which may further customise which ones are applied) [On]
    #Should be able to make this one client-sided?
- DST Content Disabler (server-side, disables dst content, items turn to air, boss never spawns, world doesn't do shit, etc) [On]
- AI Alts (server-side, enables/disables AI changes, enables changing other options which may further customise which ones are applied) [On]
- Liquid Balance (server-side, enables/disables liquid changes, will affect item costs)
- Void Bag (client-side, enable/disable craft from + consume ammo/potions from + etc) [Off]
- Show Damage Numbers (client-side, enable/disable numbers from damage, may improve performance)
- 1.4.4 Item Stacks (server-side, enable/disable) [Off]

API:
- Require Config (specifies that a mod requires a specific config setting at a certain value, and will warn the user if they try to it, conflicts should be discussed between mod teams)
- Change Config (allows other mods to change this mod's config based on conditions, abides by config requirements)
- Read/Write Entity Data (other mods may add their content to this mod's entity database or information)
